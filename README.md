### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating practical solutions for everyday issues.

Currently, working at Adyen as a Front-end engineer and also immersed in the development of my latest side-project, "Track the Habit." This is basically a habit tracker, designed to offer a simple, clear-cut way of monitoring the yearly progress of weekly habits.  

Without having to create many to-do lists this is a single list that will open checkboxes for you to fill in every week.

I took the initiative to develop this app when I realized the market lacked what I was looking for. Although still in its early stages (and with a few bugs), it's already live and I use it every day as part of my routine.

I have a very minimalistic website: [https://lucasfarias.com](lucasfarias.com) where I share updates about my ongoing projects and occasional insights into my development journey.

Feel free to reach me out if you have any suggestions or ideas.

Thanks for checking my profile.
