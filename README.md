### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating practical solutions for everyday issues.

Currently, working at Adyen as a Front-end engineer and also immersed in the development of my side-projects, which this far are:
- **TrackTheHabit**: Personal habit tracker
- **Packlify**: Web framework wrapping React for server rendered applications.

I have a very minimalistic website: [https://lucasfarias.com](https://lucasfarias.com) where I share updates about my ongoing projects and occasional insights into my development journey.

Feel free to reach me out if you have any suggestions or ideas.

Thanks for checking my profile.
